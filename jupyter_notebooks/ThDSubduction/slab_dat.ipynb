    "\n",

    "\n",
    "    https://github.com/lhy11009/Utilities/blob/master/python_scripts/Utilities.py\n",

    "- Install the gplately package (TODO: include a conda file)\n",
    "\n",
    "- One must first use gplate and export a \"reconstruction\" file for the specific timestep. This file serves to look up names and ids of the subduction zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow defines the steps to query a subduction plate dataset based on plate reconstruction data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a good dataset for a time step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Select the Automatic Workflow and get a global dataset**:\n",
    "   - Use the global dataset with the automatic workflow to initiate the data processing. This is a good reference dataset to refine points of respective trenches.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Look in the global dataset for a local subset or extract a Local dataset directly**:\n",
    "    - To directly extract a local dataset, look for a id for a trench. Put that in the workflow to extract a single trench.\n",
    "    - When we are satisfied, damp the data in to a finalized dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Resample the subduction zones**\"\n",
    "    - To discretinize the subduction zones with the appropriate interval (e.g. 200 km), an option to rample them is included in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Analyze the Finalzed Dataset** \n",

    "#### Some Notes\n",

    "##### Fixing Subducting Plate Age\n",
    "To accurately determine the age of the subducting plate, we must ensure that the points are correctly pinned to the subducting plate. This involves two workflows:\n",

    "**Automatic Workflow**: By calling the fill_NaNs value in the age raster. This will automatic fill-in the invalid vlaues\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Trench pid and subduction pid\n",
    "\n",
    "The **trench PID** and **subduction PID** correspond to the IDs used in the plate reconstruction process (TODO: look carefully in their paper).\n",
    "\n",
