The reason for this is better visualized than explained in that one could comment out this line and visualized the two vtp file we output here and see the differences. Without the cell information, only points will be shown and the interpolation we are going to perform won't know what to do. The first file will be filled with points in that way and the second points will contain zeros in the temperature field.\n",
